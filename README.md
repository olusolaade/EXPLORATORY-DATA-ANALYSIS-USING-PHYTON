The main aim of churn is to predict the churnable customers at the earliest, to identify the reason for churning.

## CONCLUSION
In conclusion, my analysis reveals several critical insights into telco customer churn. Factors such as contract type, tenure, and service usage significantly influencing churn rates. High churn among long-term customers suggests a need for improved retention strategies, possibly through personalized offers or enhanced customer support for both male and female gender. 

The youth are the main customer's of Telco, the organisation should improve more youth friendly programs that will enhance the retention of the group age.

To address these challenges, I recommend implementing proactive customer retention programs, leveraging predictive analytics to identify at-risk customers early, and enhancing the overall customer experience through targeted improvements in service delivery. 

Further research could delve deeper into demographic-specific churn patterns or explore the effectiveness of different retention strategies over time. By adopting a data-driven approach, telcos can not only reduce churn but also foster long-term customer loyalty in a competitive market landscape.
Thank you.
